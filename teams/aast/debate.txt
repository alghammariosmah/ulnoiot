#Introduction

##Energy efficiency
- reduce energy wastage
  * improving heating/cooling
  * better lighting & shading
- monitoring
  * finding resource hogs
- remote usage
  * remotely turn on/off 

##Security
- safety against natural forces
  * smoke/fire/water sensors
- security against criminals
  * motion detection
  * cameras
  * using light to simulate presence
- monitoring your home
  * children
  * pets
- facilitate the usage of security mechanisms
  * facial recognition
  * automatic door locks
- price advantage over tradtional alarm systems

##Productivity
- better working environment
- reducing work effort
- improving error handling
- optimised space usage
- time savings

#Arguments
##Energy efficiency
- reduce energy wastage
  * smart thermostats adapt to current environment
    + adapt to persons present
    + adapt to weather
    + average household would save up to 150$ a year
  * smart shading improves lighting and reduces cooling costs
  * automatically switch off devices when you leave the house
  * save 20-30% of energy
- use energy more efficiently
  * use energy when its cheapest (in the night)
- monitoring
  * retrieve precise information about your energy usage
  * spot inefficient and powerconsuming devices
- remote control
  * switch off devices remotely that you might have forgotten
    + e.g. switch off all lights at once, when you go to bed
  * switch on devices to start up before you come home


##Productivity
Benefits from automating a building:
- more comfortable working environment, (green buildings) score higher in:
  * aesthetic appearance
  * size of personal workspace
  * noise from HVAC systems
    + e.g. on days where only part of the staff is at work, the HVAC can kept at a minimum
  * ventilation & temperature
  * workplace image
  (* lighting and room temperature can be adapted to individual likings)
- reduce workload for building operations
  * parameters of the building can be adapted by individuals according to their needs.
  they do not need staff to change things.
- fix errors faster
  * building fully integrated, mistakes detected quickly
  * notification when something fails
- use space more efficiently
  * ensure building is utilised floor by floor
- save time 
  * booking workplaces, conference rooms
  * looking for colleagues
  * automatic time tracking
  * e.g. coffee machine, automatically adapts to your likings
  * e.g. printers do not print until you are nearby, so that the printer is still available for others
- save work
  * rooms that have not been used do not require cleaning that often
  * if not needed, e.g. toilet groups can be closed off 
- increase productivity
  * people working in smart buildings are 16% more productive
    + optimized air quality increases productivity by 11%
    + enhanced lighting and daylighting can increase productivity by 23%
- increase the worth of the building
  * save operational costs by up to 14%
  * increase asset value of building by 7%

Benefits from automating a home:
- score higher in:
  * sleep quality at night
  * positive mood
- save time
  * e.g. coffee machine automatically turns on and prepares a coffee to your liking
  * e.g. automatically unlock door when you come home
  * e.g. remotely turn on your oven
  * e.g. water your plants/feed pets


##Security
- safety against unexpected human/natural failures 
	* detecting fire or even smoke before fire with surveleinces or heat detectors. Thus, we can use automated water pumbers and fire extinguishers
	 in the specific rooms. 
	* in case of flooding, use automated plumping sewers, or redirect the water flow to the sewers. 

- security against criminals
  * When a theif breaks in the house, sensitive motion detectors start firing alarms and sending instant notification to the homeowners. 
  * cameras surveleinces can be used to monitor and detect movements.  
  * Automated lights in case of traveling, which simulates presence.


- monitoring your home
  * children
  * pets
- facilitate the usage of security mechanisms
  * In case relatives come to the house while you are not around, facial recognition can be used to certify home access for them.
  * automatic door locks to limit home access for these people. 

- price advantage over tradtional alarm systems
