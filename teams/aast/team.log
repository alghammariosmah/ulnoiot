##Who is who

###Florian Schrofner
who are you? why studying mobile computing?
florian, from salzburg, did my bachelors here
started mobile computing as world is becoming more mobile and its becoming more and more important topic
(chose to do masters as it offers a lot of additional hands-on experience and a open curriculum)

what do you expect from h&b?
a lot of tinkering with the raspberry
cool setups that you can try at home
new linux skills

if you were a team of 4 persons what would you bring to the table?
experienced linux user, using linux since i started my bachelors
not too much experience with sensors

###Christian Altenhofer
#Who are you, why are you studying Mobile Computing?

	*Chris, Bachelors Degree in Mobile Computing in Hagenberg.
	*I started the master because i think mobile stuff is the 
	future and i like working on mobile devices.

#What do you expect from H&B Automation?

	*I expect some hands-on on some hardware and technologies we need in our homes and future homes.
	*Maybe some stuff we can use at home as well.

#Strength and weaknesses!

	*i currently work as part time android dev. im good at programming and working 
	in a team, using version control systems.
	*not so good at dokumentation
	*not good at linux

###Gerald Teufl
#Who are you, why are you studying Mobile Computing?
Gerald from lower austria, also did the Bachelor in Mobile Computing, like the smaller systems
which are a mixture of hardware and software, using harware with sensors and develop server software, apps
and the communication between them.

#What do you expect from H&B Automation?
I already have experience with hardware devices and some IoT devices but not in the H&B area. I expect
that I can extend my skills in this area.

#Strength and weaknesses?
My strength are that I have experience with linux, hardware and networks and I like it to work in a team. I
also have no problems with documentation. A weakness and strength at the same time is that I am a 
perfectionist. Moreover, I have basic experience with git but not that much with advanced git functions.  

###Osamah Al-Ghammari
#who are you? why studying ENI?
I am Osamah Al-Ghammari, called me Sam, A computer engireering bachelor graduate and ENI master student. 

#what do you expect from h&b? 
Learning new hardware and some software skills.

#Strength and weaknesses?
good at SSH, Linux, network and security, and Python, C and Java programming langauges. 
Spending so much time programming a task.

# Video recording and preperation
	* phrasing the statements
	* prepairing arguments
	* recording video
	* written down on file debate.txt, who did what in bulletlist_debate.txt

# Debate 
## Statement round
	* contra. price, costs -> not everyone has the ability to install home automation, after years some parts break replace?
		- every tech if smart or dump, needs support. if you gear your house with eg. thermostats, why not use a smart thermostat?
	* contra. non tech affine persons cant use smart home systems
		- i think it's in the hand of the companies to design the
	* pro. every person can use home automation, the stuff is made to be used in a simple way.
	* contra. privacy, information in the internet.
		- google, you use a notebook (google.com), and use your smartphone anyways. why not use the smartphone in your network.
	* contra. economicy, big companies instead of small family buisnesses(butchery, farmers)
	* contra. security, unsave OS are used, functionality over security.
	* pro. efficiency, remotly, find energy hogs
	* pro. security, safty against natrual forces, or thievs(motion detect, thermal cams)
	* pro. productivity, provides a better working enviroment, better usage of space(shared spaces, costs)
	#### 1st. Topic Safety, Security and Privacy
	* systems may be not secure? every OS is unsecure in a way, linux for example is unsecure in a way as well.
	* private informations? privacy against convinience.
	* hardware key is not hackable! fingerprints are reproduceable.
		- you can lose your hardware key ofter equipped with tags!
	#### 2st. Topic Efficiency, Costs
	* smart theromostats, reduce the heating costs. smart shading reduce heating -> 20-30%
	* you have maintenance costs.
		- when heating/cooling is running all the time you have inefficient usage. 
		- maintenance costs are with dump devices as well. 
		so when you need a new system, why not install a smart device.
	#### 3st. Big Players, combine differnet systems, interoperability.
	* one system rules them all, give all informations to this company(amazon eco)
		- small companies like loxone keep your data private(server is in home)
	* differencial privacy (anynomise big data)
