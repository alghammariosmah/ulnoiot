#scenarios and application domains
	*light switch over the internet
	*controll remote cars over the internet -> maybe security, privacy
	*turn on stereo over the internet -> entertainment
	*home and building in bigger sense -> buildings operate/ is networking like organisms
	*operation systems -> devices interact seamingless with the supply management.
	*dynamic route management for lifts etc. -> energy, logistics

#technologies
	*internet
	*plug and go
	*modular buildings
	*access control systems (open door concept)
	*smart light systems	

#feasibility, what doable, what not, when?
	*remote turn on devices, now
	*self driving cars, now under some concerns(prototypes).
	*dynamic routing (start up with chailift, to reduce the "jams")
	*access control system, now under some conerns (not like in the clip)
	*smart light systems, now

#weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?)
	*security, can everybode use this, surveillance?
	*modular buildings, in sense of changing rooms.
