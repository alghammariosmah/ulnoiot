#### Statement round
	* contra. price, costs -> not everyone has the ability to install home automation, after years some parts break replace?
		- every tech if smart or dump, needs support. if you gear your house with eg. thermostats, why not use a smart thermostat?
	* contra. non tech affine persons cant use smart home systems
		- i think it's in the hand of the companies to design the
	* pro. every person can use home automation, the stuff is made to be used in a simple way.
	* contra. privacy, information in the internet.
		- google, you use a notebook (google.com), and use your smartphone anyways. why not use the smartphone in your network.
	* contra. economicy, big companies instead of small family buisnesses(butchery, farmers)
	* contra. security, unsave OS are used, functionality over security.
	* pro. efficiency, remotly, find energy hogs
	* pro. security, safty against natrual forces, or thievs(motion detect, thermal cams)
	* pro. productivity, provides a better working enviroment, better usage of space(shared spaces, costs)
	#### 1st. Topic Safety, Security and Privacy
	* systems may be not secure? every OS is unsecure in a way, linux for example is unsecure in a way as well.
	* private informations? privacy against convinience.
	* hardware key is not hackable! fingerprints are reproduceable.
		- you can lose your hardware key ofter equipped with tags!
	#### 2st. Topic Efficiency, Costs
	* smart theromostats, reduce the heating costs. smart shading reduce heating -> 20-30%
	* you have maintenance costs.
		- when heating/cooling is running all the time you have inefficient usage. 
		- maintenance costs are with dump devices as well. 
		so when you need a new system, why not install a smart device.
	#### 3st. Big Players, combine differnet systems, interoperability.
	* one system rules them all, give all informations to this company(amazon eco)
		- small companies like loxone keep your data private(server is in home)
	* differencial privacy (anynomise big data)
