## 08:50 - 09:20 who am i

###Who are you, why are you studying Mobile Computing?

	* Chris, Bachelors Degree in Mobile Computing in Hagenberg.
	* I started the master because i think mobile stuff is the 
	future and i like working on mobile devices.

###What do you expect from H&B Automation?

	* I expect some hands-on on some hardware and technologies we need in our homes and future homes.
	* Maybe some stuff we can use at home as well.

###Strength and weaknesses!

	* i currently work as part time android dev. im good at programming and working 
	in a team, using version control systems.
	* not so good at dokumentation
	* not good at linux

## 10:00 - 10:40 showtime with discussion

###scenarios and application domains
	* light switch over the internet
	* controll remote cars over the internet -> maybe security, privacy
	* turn on stereo over the internet -> entertainment
	* home and building in bigger sense -> buildings operate/ is networking like organisms
	* operation systems -> devices interact seamingless with the supply management.
	* dynamic route management for lifts etc. -> energy, logistics

###technologies
	* internet
	* plug and go
	* modular buildings
	* access control systems (open door concept)
	* smart light systems	

###feasibility, what doable, what not, when?
	* remote turn on devices, now
	* self driving cars, now under some concerns(prototypes).
	* dynamic routing (start up with chailift, to reduce the "jams")
	* access control system, now under some conerns (not like in the clip)
	* smart light systems, now with additional hardware(like amazon harmony hub)

###weirdness/crazyness (any concerns?)
	* security, can everybode use this, surveillance?
	* modular buildings, in sense of changing rooms.

## 10:40 - 12:00 setup repository
	* add personal log files
	* created folder hirachy

# Starting the practical part

## 13:00 - 16:15 get started with raspberry pi
	* connect notebook the the wifi iotempire-xxxxxx
	* connection to the correct device, check with usb stick and check mounts
	* problems encountered: 
		* could not connect to the pi
		* after password nothing happens(no sessions/servers appeared)
		* wrong passwords will be reconized
		* used putty.exe
		* tried with git-bash works like a charm
		* ssh pi@192.168.12.1 do the work
		* putty version wasnt working correctly.
	* device: pi zero + powersupply + wmos
	* setup putty.exe with hostname pi@192.168.12.1 pass: ulnoiot, connect
	* let the led flash up on the wmos adapter
#### led blink step by step
	* connection archieved
	* 2 break // use 2. byobu session
	* to enter wifi access point, F6 to exit
	* 3 to use ulnoiot
	* plug in wmos wifi adapter
	* wip // check ip
	* flash_wmosd1mini // flash the adapter
	* deploy_wmosd1mini // deploy the adapter, flash+deploy puts the configs on the adpater
	* console // enter interface console
	* help("wifi") // wifi help
	* wifi("iotempire-392bf9", "internetofthings") // reset the adapter
	* onboardled.init(Pin.OUT) // init the led on the adapter
	* onboardled.on() // on/off is switched, due to the wireing in the adapter
	* close console // ctrl + altgr + 9
#### update and use wifi
	* on the ulnoiot interface -> git pull -> download_firmware -> 
	* fix_bin
	* flash_ESP8266
	* deploy_wmosd1wmini
	* console
	* wifi("iotempire-392bf9", "internetofthings") // new connect we flashed new firmwarew
	* reset()	
	* wip
	* mqtt("192.186.12.1", "test") // ip of the raspberry pi not the apdater
	* import ulnoiot.shield.devkit1_2led3but
	* devices
	* run()
	* rapberrypi: mqtt_send test/devicename/set on

## 16:15 - XX:XX research for debate
	*
