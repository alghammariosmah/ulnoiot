# x10 industry standard

## Introduction
* home automation communication protocol
* it uses power line wiring for signaling and control
* short radio frequency bursts hold the digital information

## Power line carrier control
* the digital data is send on the electrical wiring of the household devices and light wiring
* the data is encoded on a 120 kHz carrier frequence,
* transmitted as short bursts
* data consists of an address and a command
* data is sent from controller to the device
* advanced devices can receive/request with a more advanced status
	+ status may be: on/off, dimming level, temperature or other sensing reading.

## Protocol
* The transmitted X10 packages consists:
	+ 4bit house code followed by 1-4bit unit codes followd by 4bit command
* for more convinient system configuration:
	+ house code is selected as a letter from A - P
	+ unit code is a number from 1 - 16
* each device is configured to respond to one of the 256 possible addressed (16 x 16)
* the device reacts to commands specifically addressed to it, or to a broadcast
* transmitted message example:
	+ "select A3" followed by "turn on", which means:
	+ unit "A3" should turn on its device

* One-way devices: only receive commands and do not ACK their status
* Two-way devices: ACK their status to the network. More expensive
