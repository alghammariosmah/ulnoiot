### Environmentally friendly, increase energy efficiency, less costs:
	* dim, turn off lights.
		- walk out of the door and forget to turn off light? check via smartphone, if so switch off remotely.
		- There are some applications which allow you to turn off all lights with a simple click on one button. 
		This may be helpful when you go to bed and dont want to check if the light are switched off in every room in the whole house.
		
	* Thermostats for controll temperature perfect. 
		- most thermostats are already programmable nowadays, which is actual a home automation device.
		- but how often are the schedules overriden or adapted by hand?
		these thermostats in addition with some smart sensors will help you to cool/heat your flat
		in the most efficient possible way. The sensors check the current temperature inside as well as outside and adapt
		the temperature perfectly and automated.
		- those smarthome tools are note only eco-savvy, they are also very easy on the wallet,  
		Just use the smartphone or the computer to inform the smart thermostat or A/C that you coming home,
		or that you will arrive later. The thermostat and A/C now can perfectly adapt the temperature in a cost
		efficiant way because it doesnt heat up or cool down your flat when it hasnt to.

	* can all be controlled and monitored for optimal energy efficiency, cost savings.
		- a variety of monitors can provide information of power usage of the plugged items in the home.
		- you will get a precice information of the electricity usage of the the entire home.
		- also you can spot out inefficient and huge powerconsuming devices, like fridges, and maybe replace them with newer models.
		- some electical power providers have some kind of lower rates on non-peak usage times.
		with the monitoring you can spot out this timeslots and supply the big usage items in these times.
		- as in the article of smarthome.com a average household in the USA spends nearly 2000$ a year on
		energy costs. 45% percent of this costs are only for heating and cooling. As already mentioned most common 
		homes are already equiped with programmable thermostats. 
		Depending on the climate you can save up to 150$ on your yearly bills just by programm those thermostats
		right and use the heating and cooling in the most efficient way, by automate the thermostat program.

	* Statements:
		- Smart thermostats worth some serious consideration. 
		The premise is simple and compelling: smarter control of your heating, remote access and the promise of energy savings of 20-30%
		- By side the smart thermostats also other stuff is able to be monitored. You can use some sensors and detect the devices of you home
		which consume the most power, and maybe replace them with more efficient models.
