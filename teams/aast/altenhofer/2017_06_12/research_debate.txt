### Environmentally friendly, increase energy efficiency, less costs:		
	
	* energy efficiency
		- use your thermostats in a smart way:
			* most thermostats are already programmable but how often are the schedules overriden or adapted by hand?
			these thermostats in addition with some smart sensors will help you to cool/heat your flat
			in the most efficient possible way. The sensors check the current temperature inside as well as outside and adapt
			the temperature perfectly and automated.
			* also use shading by checking the sunlight income to reduce cooling power in the summer time.
		- save costs:
			* as in the article of smarthome.com a average household in the USA spends nearly 2000$ a year on energy costs. 
			* 45% percent of this costs are only for heating and cooling. As already mentioned most common 
			homes are already equiped with programmable thermostats. Depending on the climate you can save up to 150$ on your yearly bills just by programm those thermostats
			right and use the heating and cooling in the most efficient way, by automate the thermostat program.	
			* those smarthome tools are not only eco-savvy, they are also very easy on the wallet,  
			Just use the smartphone or the computer to inform the smart thermostat or A/C that you coming home,
			or that you will arrive later. The thermostat and A/C now can perfectly adapt the temperature in a cost
			efficiant way because it doesnt heat up or cool down your flat when it hasnt to.	
		
	* monitoring
		- remote:
			* walk out of the door and forget to turn off light? check via smartphone, if so switch off remotely.
			* There are some applications which allow you to turn off all lights with a simple click on one button. 
			This may be helpful when you go to bed and dont want to check if the light are switched off in every room in the whole house.
		- gather Informations:
			* a variety of monitors can provide information of power usage of the plugged items in the home.
			* you will get a precice information of the electricity usage of the the entire home.
			* also you can spot out inefficient and huge powerconsuming devices, like fridges, and maybe replace them with newer models.
			* some electical power providers have some kind of lower rates on non-peak usage times -> supply your devices during those times.


	* Pro Statements:
		- Smart thermostats worth some serious consideration. 
		The premise is simple and compelling: smarter control of your heating, remote access and the promise of energy savings of 20-30%
		- By side the smart thermostats also other stuff is able to be monitored. You can use some sensors and detect the devices of you home
		which consume the most power, and maybe replace them with more efficient models.

	* Con Statements:
		- security issues, another instance of vulnerability. Attacker can use low secured devices like webcams, 
		baby cams to get access to the network. --> Useage of the devices only in home network (LAN). Only one device
		(router) has access to the internet, not more vulnerable than any other device.
		- Cost. Some smart products can be fairly expensive.
		- Learning. There may be some learning curve for non-tech savvy people.
		- Reliability. Smart homes are reliant on your internet connection.
