### Environmentally friendly, increase energy efficiency, less costs:		
	
	* energy efficiency
		- use your thermostats in a smart way:
			* most thermostats are already programmable but how often are the schedules overriden or adapted by hand?
			these thermostats in addition with some smart sensors will help you to cool/heat your flat
			in the most efficient possible way. The sensors check the current temperature inside as well as outside and adapt
			the temperature perfectly and automated.
			* also use shading by checking the sunlight income to reduce cooling power in the summer time.
		- save costs:
			* as in the article of smarthome.com a average household in the USA spends nearly 2000$ a year on energy costs. 
			* 45% percent of this costs are only for heating and cooling. As already mentioned most common 
			homes are already equiped with programmable thermostats. Depending on the climate you can save up to 150$ on your yearly bills just by programm those thermostats
			right and use the heating and cooling in the most efficient way, by automate the thermostat program.	
			* those smarthome tools are not only eco-savvy, they are also very easy on the wallet,  
			Just use the smartphone or the computer to inform the smart thermostat or A/C that you coming home,
			or that you will arrive later. The thermostat and A/C now can perfectly adapt the temperature in a cost
			efficiant way because it doesnt heat up or cool down your flat when it hasnt to.	
		
	* monitoring
		- remote:
			* walk out of the door and forget to turn off light? check via smartphone, if so switch off remotely.
			* There are some applications which allow you to turn off all lights with a simple click on one button. 
			This may be helpful when you go to bed and dont want to check if the light are switched off in every room in the whole house.
		- gather Informations:
			* a variety of monitors can provide information of power usage of the plugged items in the home.
			* you will get a precice information of the electricity usage of the the entire home.
			* also you can spot out inefficient and huge powerconsuming devices, like fridges, and maybe replace them with newer models.
			* some electical power providers have some kind of lower rates on non-peak usage times -> supply your devices during those times.

	* Pro Statements:
		- Smart thermostats worth some serious consideration. 
		The premise is simple and compelling: smarter control of your heating, remote access and the promise of energy savings of 20-30%
		- By side the smart thermostats also other stuff is able to be monitored. You can use some sensors and detect the devices of you home
		which consume the most power, and maybe replace them with more efficient models.

# Contra Starting:
	
## Security
 * we get another instance of vulnerability
 * privacy 
 * functionality over security
 * smart homes rely on the internet
## Costs and productivity
 * most of the products are pretty expensive
 * additional devices consume power as well
 * no tech affine persons need support effort.
## efficiency
 * all the devices needs to setup and programmed properly to work efficience
 * suming up of all connected devices the power consumption is not as good as expected.
	
# Con Statements:

## Security
 * security issues because we need another vulnerability. 
 Attacker can use low secured devices like webcams, baby cams to get access to the network.
 * privacy, you send some personal data over the internet. for example what do you eat,
 when you have like a smart fridge who reorders goods automatically.
 * scada OS which is used for energy systems and pretty prone for attacks.  
 * most companies which create smart systems dont put much effort into security, functionality is in the forground.
 * most of the functionality like remotely turning on and off lights, the AC or the heating relies on a internet connection,
 so if your devices are not connected to the internet they are dump devices and cant be used in a smart way. 
 Sending data on the internet may cause additional costs. some roaming fees as well, when remote controll stuff on vacation.
## Costs and productivity
 * most of the products are pretty expensive when buying them. you need a huge amount of devices to get usable smart features. 
 for example the philipps hue starter pack, just to turn on lights over the network costs 73 euros on amazon.
 * additional devices consume power as well. many sensors consume a lot of power, you need to setup your devices properly to get the
 most out of it. most of the people are not able to setup and programm those devices so they consume more power than save it.
 * no tech affine persons need technical support. if a company setup your system you need their support in an error case.
## Efficiency
 * For normal users its pretty error prone when setting up and program bigger home automation system. 
 All the devices needs to setup and programmed properly to be used efficient. Every device which is not setup correctly is just another
 device which consumes power over the whole day.
 * Summing up of all connected devices and sensors the power consumption is not as good as expected.
