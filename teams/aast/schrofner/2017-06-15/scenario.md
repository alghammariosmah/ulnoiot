#Scenario

##Our friend
Wealthy, young, modern and tech-savvy guy. Inherited a huge house, but lives alone.
Wants to earn some extra money by renting out his additional bed rooms on Airbnb.
He wants to use home automation to simplify the process as much as possible and improve the security of his home.
As he is technically inclined, he wants to build most of the automation himself.

##Goals
-Simplify new arrivals
  * Unlock the door remotely when they arrive
  * Give them access cards/Let them use their phone for authentication
  
-Improve the quality of living for his guests
  * Smart thermostats
  * Smart airconditioning
  * Smart shades
  * Media centers in the bedrooms
  * Let them adapt parameters using their smartphone/Alexa/Google Echo
    
-Managing shared resources
  * Let guests notify him, when something runs out (toilet paper, etc.) (like Amazon Dash maybe?)
  * Let guests share resources with others (e.g. bought too many onions)
  * Smart washing machine
    + Notification when ready
    + Check if currently used
  
-Make sure his guests follow the house rules
  * Track bathroom time
  * Track noise after 22:00
  * Make sure they clean up the kitchen (maybe using cameras)
  
-Introduce access control
  * Do not let the guests enter rooms they are not supposed to (garage, other bedrooms, ...)
  * Invalidate their access, after their stay
  
-Security
  * Add motion sensors and cameras
  * Let him check the current situation inside the house remotely
