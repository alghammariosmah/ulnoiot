# create virtual environment

# enter virtual environment

# build and install spi layer (make sure to also activate spi in sudo raspi-config!)

############
Remember that you have to activate the environment before you run a python script.
If you want to build a script which does this automatically, create somethign like the
following:

=== start in environment ====
#!/bin/bash

# find directory of this script
dir=$(cd -P -- "$(dirname -- "$0")" && pwd -P)
cd "$dir" # go there

# assume that the activation script is at ../bin/activate
. ../bin/activate

# execute my python program (change myscript to your script name)
python myscript.py
=============================
after creating this file on the pi, make it executable with
chmod a+x envstart.py # make sure to adapt name to environment script name
