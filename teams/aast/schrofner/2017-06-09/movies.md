scenarios & application domains
1. switch on light, turn down stereo, control cars
2. buildings into living organism, adapting to users, managing water & energy, evacuation scenarios

technologies
1. internet, radio (for cars)
2. modular building, mobile equipment integrated seamlessly

feasibility
- what doable?
- what not?
- when?
1. light: totally doable, right now
1. stereo: doable, but need to figure out the controls and maybe build it oneself
1. cars: also doable, but might be harder
2. seems to be still far in the future
2. personal assistant/navigation inside buildings already possible
2. light management system also doable

weirdness/crazyness (concerns?)
1. light: except from their behaviour, it is not weird
1. cars: weird
2. security concerns! what if that building would be hacked?
2. centralised approach
