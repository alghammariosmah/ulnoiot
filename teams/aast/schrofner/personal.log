###Myself
who are you? why studying mobile computing?
florian, from salzburg, did my bachelors here
started mobile computing as world is becoming more mobile and its becoming more and more important topic
(chose to do masters as it offers a lot of additional hands-on experience and a open curriculum)

what do you expect from h&b?
a lot of tinkering with the raspberry
cool setups that you can try at home
new linux skills

if you were a team of 4 persons what would you bring to the table?
experienced linux user, using linux since i started my bachelors
not too much experience with sensors

###Movies
scenarios & application domains
1. switch on light, turn down stereo, control cars
2. buildings into living organism, adapting to users, managing water & energy, evacuation scenarios

technologies
1. internet, radio (for cars)
2. modular building, mobile equipment integrated seamlessly

feasibility
- what doable?
- what not?
- when?
1. light: totally doable, right now
1. stereo: doable, but need to figure out the controls and maybe build it oneself
1. cars: also doable, but might be harder
2. seems to be still far in the future
2. personal assistant/navigation inside buildings already possible
2. light management system also doable

weirdness/crazyness (concerns?)
1. light: except from their behaviour, it is not weird
1. cars: weird
2. security concerns! what if that building would be hacked?
2. centralised approach

###Practical part
Plugin pi, connect to strongest ap using password: internetofthings

Open a terminal an use:
ssh pi@192.168.12.1

Using the password: ulnoiot

Once connected a byobu will open up
f2 can be used to create a new session

You can verify that you're connected with the correct pi by issuing "lsblk", then plugin a usb stick and run "lsblk" again to verify that the usb stick is detected

You can add your ssh key by adding your pub key to: /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys

Start the ulnoiot environment by using the "ulnoiot" command
Then you can flash wemosd1mini with the "flash_wemosd1mini" command
You can create the system by issuing the "deploy_wemosd1mini" command (twice as some folders are not created in the right order)

You can rename the wifi network and change the password by editing the /home/pi/ulnoiot/etc/ulnoiot.conf file

Using "console" you can connect to the wemosd1mini
Initialise the led by using "onboardled.init(Pin.OUT)"
Switch it on and off with: "onboardled.on()" and "onboardled.off()"

You can connect the wemosd1mini with the wifi of the raspberry pi by issuing:
wifi("teuschro","schroteu") replacing the two values with the name and the password of the wifi

You can make sure that the wifi is detected by issuing "wscan"

Once connected to the wifi, you need to take note of the ip address with "wip".
in our case: 192.168.12.18

You can change the address by editing the "wifi_config.py" with "lineedit("wifi_config.py", 3)"

"git pull" pulls the newest firmware changes onto the raspberry pi
"firmware_download" downloads the newest firmware
"fix_bin" to fix the binary
"flash_esp8266" to flash the new firmware onto the wimos
"deploy_wemosd1mini" to deploy the python scripts again

"reset" should be executed before connecting to the mqtt server

To connect to the MQTT server on the raspberry pi, you can use "mqtt("192.168.12.1","test")"

To load the functions to control the led shield use "import devkit1_2led3but"

Finally use the "run" command so that the mqtt messages can be received

###Debate

"Green buildings score more highly on: aesthetic appearance, view; size of personal workspace; noise from HVAC systems; ventilation & temperature; preferred change in thermal conditions; frequency of thermal adaptive behaviours; workplace image; sleep quality at night; positive mood; visual and physical discomfort frequency

Conventional buildings were not better on any outcome"

https://w3.usa.siemens.com/buildingtechnologies/us/en/Documents/LinkProject/Smart-building-white-paper-FINAL-2012.pdf

"It’s easy to see how integration can bring gains. Consider a high security building that requires tenants to use a swipe card or key fob to gain building access, says Brad Molotsky, executive vice president and general counsel for Brandywine Realty Trust, a leading REIT. On some days, the tenants may only have 50 percent of their staff in the office. That information can be relayed to the HVAC system through the building automation system so the outside air dampers do not bring in unnecessary outside air"
-> It can regulate the climate inside the building according to the number of people inside, so that a perfect working environment can be achieved.

"One major advantage of a smart building is that it improves productivity. At the Los Angeles Convention Center, the work load associated with building operations is significantly reduced with today’s integrated technology, compared to 20 or 30 years ago. “Back then, we had a stack of work orders,” says Castro. “We would have to walk to each location and figure out what they wanted and what parameters needed to change to achieve that. It took a little army to do all this work.”
-> Parameters of the building can be adapted by individuals according to their need. They do not need staff to change things.

"What’s more, a smart building functions better. “When you get fully integrated with a single platform for building operating functions, the biggest benefit is operators are more aware of what’s happening in the building,” says Robert Knight, senior associate with Environmental Systems Design, an engineering design firm. “Mistakes get fixed faster. The facilities staff can be more responsive to tenant comfort.”"
-> Mistakes can get fixed faster, as they are recognised faster.

"Soft benefits, such as higher occupancy rates or lease prices, healthier occupants with higher productivity, or marketing cachet, are difficult to quantify and can shift by orders of magnitude based on the assumptions and stipulations made"
-> These benefits are certainly there, but hard to quantify.

"In a Smart Building, you will not lose time looking for workplaces, conference rooms, colleagues, patients or equipment (see Interaction). Moreover, not only does the lighting and room temperature adapt to your requirements , the coffee machine also remembers how much sugar and milk you require. And when equipment is defect, the manager of that particular facility will automatically receive notification."
-> Saves valuable time for employees. Coffee machine is also an example how automation could save you time at home. It could automatically startup as soon as you wake up and prepare your coffee for you, just how you like it.

"The square metres of available floor space are also fully utilised. The app that automatically assigns workplaces and conference rooms (see Interaction), ensures that the building is utilised floor by floor. A floor or wing that is not occupied on a particular day hardly requires lighting, heating or cleaning. Savings can also be made on floors that are only partially occupied, e.g. by closing off part of the toilet groups, or by indicating whether a desk has been used that day and therefore whether it requires cleaning or not."
-> Room can be used more efficiently, saves money. Work can automatically be reduced, when not needed like cleaning.

https://wipebook.com/blogs/news/can-smart-buildings-increase-productivity

"UCLA conducted a study indicating that employees within smart buildings are 16% more productive than their counterparts working in traditional companies that do not prioritize environmental friendliness."
"Even further: Data from the World Green Building Council also illuminates (no pun intended) smart buildings' potential to enhance productivity by a similar percentage."
-> By creating and environmental, healthy working climate people will also become more productive.

"Additionally, Dodge Data and Analytics suggests that smart buildings, either newly built or the product of renovations, save businesses operational costs by up to 14 percent while increasing buildings' asset value by 7 percent."
-> Buildings become worth more!
