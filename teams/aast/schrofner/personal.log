###Myself
who are you? why studying mobile computing?
florian, from salzburg, did my bachelors here
started mobile computing as world is becoming more mobile and its becoming more and more important topic
(chose to do masters as it offers a lot of additional hands-on experience and a open curriculum)

what do you expect from h&b?
a lot of tinkering with the raspberry
cool setups that you can try at home
new linux skills

if you were a team of 4 persons what would you bring to the table?
experienced linux user, using linux since i started my bachelors
not too much experience with sensors

###Movies
scenarios & application domains
1. switch on light, turn down stereo, control cars
2. buildings into living organism, adapting to users, managing water & energy, evacuation scenarios

technologies
1. internet, radio (for cars)
2. modular building, mobile equipment integrated seamlessly

feasibility
- what doable?
- what not?
- when?
1. light: totally doable, right now
1. stereo: doable, but need to figure out the controls and maybe build it oneself
1. cars: also doable, but might be harder
2. seems to be still far in the future
2. personal assistant/navigation inside buildings already possible
2. light management system also doable

weirdness/crazyness (concerns?)
1. light: except from their behaviour, it is not weird
1. cars: weird
2. security concerns! what if that building would be hacked?
2. centralised approach

###Practical part
Plugin pi, connect to strongest ap using password: internetofthings

Open a terminal an use:
ssh pi@192.168.12.1

Using the password: ulnoiot

Once connected a byobu will open up
f2 can be used to create a new session

You can verify that you're connected with the correct pi by issuing "lsblk", then plugin a usb stick and run "lsblk" again to verify that the usb stick is detected

You can add your ssh key by adding your pub key to: /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys

Start the ulnoiot environment by using the "ulnoiot" command
Then you can flash wemosd1mini with the "flash_wemosd1mini" command
You can create the system by issuing the "deploy_wemosd1mini" command (twice as some folders are not created in the right order)

You can rename the wifi network and change the password by editing the /home/pi/ulnoiot/etc/ulnoiot.conf file

Using "console" you can connect to the wemosd1mini
Initialise the led by using "onboardled.init(Pin.OUT)"
Switch it on and off with: "onboardled.on()" and "onboardled.off()"

You can connect the wemosd1mini with the wifi of the raspberry pi by issuing:
wifi("teuschro","schroteu") replacing the two values with the name and the password of the wifi

You can make sure that the wifi is detected by issuing "wscan"

Once connected to the wifi, you need to take note of the ip address with "wip".
in our case: 192.168.12.18

You can change the address by editing the "wifi_config.py" with "lineedit("wifi_config.py", 3)"

"git pull" pulls the newest firmware changes onto the raspberry pi
"firmware_download" downloads the newest firmware
"fix_bin" to fix the binary
"flash_esp8266" to flash the new firmware onto the wimos
"deploy_wemosd1mini" to deploy the python scripts again

"reset" should be executed before connecting to the mqtt server

To connect to the MQTT server on the raspberry pi, you can use "mqtt("192.168.12.1","test")"

To load the functions to control the led shield use "import devkit1_2led3but"

Finally use the "run" command so that the mqtt messages can be received

###Debate

"Green buildings score more highly on: aesthetic appearance, view; size of personal workspace; noise from HVAC systems; ventilation & temperature; preferred change in thermal conditions; frequency of thermal adaptive behaviours; workplace image; sleep quality at night; positive mood; visual and physical discomfort frequency

Conventional buildings were not better on any outcome"

https://w3.usa.siemens.com/buildingtechnologies/us/en/Documents/LinkProject/Smart-building-white-paper-FINAL-2012.pdf

"Itâ€™s easy to see how integration can bring gains. Consider a high security building that requires tenants to use a swipe card or key fob to gain building access, says Brad Molotsky, executive vice president and general counsel for Brandywine Realty Trust, a leading REIT. On some days, the tenants may only have 50 percent of their staff in the office. That information can be relayed to the HVAC system through the building automation system so the outside air dampers do not bring in unnecessary outside air"
