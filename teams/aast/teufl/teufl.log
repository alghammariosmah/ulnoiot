## Gerald Teufl
### Who are you, why are you studying Mobile Computing?
Gerald from lower austria, also did the Bachelor in Mobile Computing, like the smaller systems
which are a mixture of hardware and software, using harware with sensors and develop server software, apps
and the communication between them.

### What do you expect from H&B Automation?
I already have experience with hardware devices and some IoT devices but not in the H&B area. I expect
that I can extend my skills in this area.

### Strength and weaknesses?
My strength are that I have experience with linux, hardware and networks and I like it to work in a team. I
also have no problems with documentation. A weakness and strength at the same time is that I am a 
perfectionist. Moreover, I have basic experience with git but not that much with advanced git functions. 


## Watching two movies and answer questions
What might be doable?
What not?
When?
Weirdness/crazyness?

### Movie 1
	* Lamp -> doable
	* Stereo, Music Player -> doable
	* Public access -> doable
	* Public access for all things -> not doable in this way they showed
	* Security/Privacy -> weird, crazy

#### Technologies
Wireless access, networks

### Movie 2
	* Displays -> AR, VR, just one guy monitors everything
	* Holograms -> not in the near future
	* Rooms moving -> doable but quiet far away
	* Doorless doors -> what if somebody is not allowed to enter?
	* Navigation -> doable
	* Modularity -> doable
	* Intelligent networking -> doable
	* Energy management -> near future
	* Lightning reacts on emergancy, reaction on full escape ways
	* Security -> increase security but also opens new doors for security issues

## Raspberry Pi setup
	1. Flash micro sd card with ulnoiot
	2. Connect to wifi access point of Raspberry Pi 3 (iotempire-b78ea5)
	3. Connect Raspberry Pi also via LAN to get internet access
	4. Connect via ssh to the raspberry pi 3, password: internetofthings
	5. Change password authentication to public/private key authentication
	6. Create key pair and copy public key to authorized keys on raspberry pi 3
	7. change wifi access point name to "teuschro" with password "schroteu"

mcedit -> editor

## wemosd1mini setup
	1. Type "ulnoiot" command to get into the environment
	2. wemosd1mini can then be flashed with the command "flash_wemosd1mini"
	3. Next step is to deploy with the command "deploy_wemosd1mini" (2 times probably)

type "console" -> serial connection
"help" -> help documentation

## Blue led
	* init led -> "onboardled.init(Pin.OUT)"
	* toggle led (on, off) -> "onboardled.on()" and "onboardled.off()"

## Connect wemosd1mini with wifi
	1. wscan -> scan wifi networks
	2. wifi("teuschro", "schroteu") -> for connecting to the access point
	3. wip -> shows wireless ip -> 192.168.12.18

	* pull git repo for new firmware on Raspberry Pi 3
	* firmware download -> download newest firmware
	* fix_bin -> binary fixes
	* flash_esp8266 -> flashing
	* again deploying

Micropython webrepl was not working with Firefox on Linux and Windows but
it worked on Microsoft's Edge browser on Windows

## Public/Subscriber mqtt
	1. reset()
	2. mqtt("192.168.12.1", "test")
	3. help("shield")
	4. import devkit1_2led3but (depends in which folder we are currently)
	5. devices -> show devices
	6. run() -> to start

byobu -> session management system

Reasearch for pro Home and Building Automation especially security and safety improvements.

http://www.networkworld.com/article/2925722/security0/home-security-demystified-how-to-build-a-smart-diy-system.html
	* Home securtiy systems -> cheaper than traditional alarm systems because you have not to pay monthly fees
	* Surveillance of you home to protect it against criminals
	* Using water sensors for monitoring the flow of the water for example water plants, fountain, swimming pools, creeks
	* Using smoke sensors to get notifications when smoke is in your home
	* Using fire sensors to alarm the user when it is burning

http://www.techradar.com/how-to/world-of-tech/how-to-protect-your-smart-home-1328600
	* Camera based systems to protect you home
	* Intelligent door bell which uses cameras for monitoring or for face recognition
	* Motion detection

http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper%5CSmart-Home-Automated-Control-System-Using-Android-Application-and-Microcontroller.pdf
	* Home saftey secure system

wemos has not enough memory for certificate evaluation

## Starting using a smartlock
	1. Connect relay to the wemosd1mini and the smartlock
	2. Console to connect to wemosd1mini
	3. reset()
	4. Start mqtt with mqtt("192.168.12.1", "lock")
	5. Then import "relay" with import ulnoiot.shield.relay (depends in which folder you are currently)
	6. Check available devices with "devices" command
	7. run() -> run driver
	8. Test program with mqtt_send lock/relay/set on and off on Raspberry Pi 3

## Raspberry Pi 3 NFC setup
	1. Connect the NFC board to the Raspberry Pi 3 using a empty board, NFC board, Pi Viiros board and a flat cable
	2. Image teams/aast/teufl/images/nfc_viiros_boards_connection.png shows the construction
	3. Connect the flat cable to the Pi Viiros board and the Raspberry Pi 3 connectors
	4. Image teams/aast/teufl/images/nfc_raspberrypi3_finish.png shows the finished construction
	5. Install NFC driver like described on https://goo.gl/sE23Vo
