## Gerald Teufl
### Who are you, why are you studying Mobile Computing?
Gerald from lower austria, also did the Bachelor in Mobile Computing, like the smaller systems
which are a mixture of hardware and software, using harware with sensors and develop server software, apps
and the communication between them.

### What do you expect from H&B Automation?
I already have experience with hardware devices and some IoT devices but not in the H&B area. I expect
that I can extend my skills in this area.

### Strength and weaknesses?
My strength are that I have experience with linux, hardware and networks and I like it to work in a team. I
also have no problems with documentation. A weakness and strength at the same time is that I am a 
perfectionist. Moreover, I have basic experience with git but not that much with advanced git functions. 


## Watching two movies and answer questions
What might be doable?
What not?
When?
Weirdness/crazyness?

### Movie 1
	* Lamp -> doable
	* Stereo, Music Player -> doable
	* Public access -> doable
	* Public access for all things -> not doable in this way they showed
	* Security/Privacy -> weird, crazy

#### Technologies
Wireless access, networks

### Movie 2
	* Displays -> AR, VR, just one guy monitors everything
	* Holograms -> not in the near future
	* Rooms moving -> doable but quiet far away
	* Doorless doors -> what if somebody is not allowed to enter?
	* Navigation -> doable
	* Modularity -> doable
	* Intelligent networking -> doable
	* Energy management -> near future
	* Lightning reacts on emergancy, reaction on full escape ways
	* Security -> increase security but also opens new doors for security issues

## Debate notes
### Cons
	* cost effiency -> hire company -> not everyone has the ability to build a system, 40 years that it will get profitable
	* makes life much more complicated
	* google knows the answer of people when using smartphones -> using for home automation 
	* they are creating profiles of everyone
	* economics -> kills small scale industries -> supermarkets
	* security -> no one cares about that
	* not so complex to raise false alarms
	* save 100€ per year -> not much -> tooks 10 years but costs maintainance

### Pros
	* also not technical persons can use home and bulding automation systems
	* safety -> able to control and sense everything -> emergency
	* connect to your neighborhood
	* time savings
	* energy savings -> reduce energy wastage
	* save money -> smart shading -> 20% - 30% saving of energy
	* usage -> monitoring

### Questions
	* You said that cameras can produce false alarms -> but better 1 or two false alarms than your home is empty after vacation
	* Comfort, price? Comfort is more important tan price -> years ago we have no smartphones but now a lot of people bye a 700€
	  iPhone every year
	* Everything is hackable? -> nothing is 100% safe, you also will do trips to other countries altough there were some terrorist
	  attacks or not?	

## Setting up python scripts to lock/unlock door lock with NFC
### Python NFC script
	1. Install python mqtt library with cmmand "pip install paho-mqtt" on Raspberry Pi 3
	2. Copy python script read.py from home/pi/ulnoiot/pi.nfc/MFRC522-python and rename it to nfc-lock.py
	3. Import mqtt library (import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt)
	4. Add code to the file to connect to the mqtt server and publish the command to unlock the door lock
	5. The added lines are "client = mqtt.Client()", "client.connect("192.168.12.1")" and "client.publish("lock/relay/set", "on")"
	
On the wemosd1mini subscribe on the mqtt server, import the driver and start running it

### Python brocker script
Then second script is a python brocker script which subscribes in the nfc-id topic and listens for ids. When ids
arrive they will be checked if they are valid ones. If they are valid the door lock will be unlocked and then automatically 
locked again after 5 seconds

```python
	import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
	from threading import Timer

	authorized_keys = ["b'102-247-124-65'"]

	def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
        	print("Connected with result code "+str(rc))
        	client.subscribe("nfc-id")

	def lock():
        	client.publish("lock/relay/set", "off")

	def unlock():
        	client.publish("lock/relay/set", "on")


	def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
        	print("checking if key: " + str(authorized_keys))
        	print("received key: " + str(msg.payload))
        	if str(msg.payload) in authorized_keys:
                	print("valid key detected")
                	unlock()
                	timer = Timer(5.0, lock)
                	timer.start()


	client = mqtt.Client()
	client.on_connect = on_connect
	client.on_message = on_message

	client.connect("192.168.12.1")

	client.loop_forever()
```

### wemosd1mini start script
Create a user.py script with the follwoing lines of code:
```
from ulnoiot import *
import ulnoiot.shield.relay

mqtt("192.168.12.1", "lock")
run()
```

## Serial connection from the laptop or pc
Therfore, the program minicom or picocom can be used with the command for example "picocom -b 115200 -l -r /dev/ttyUSB0"

## Temperature sensor
	1. Connect temperature sensor shield to wemosd1mini
	2. Download new firmware because there was a bug in the script
	3. Then flash and deploy wemosd1mini using the same steps as written in log on Friday 9. June
	4. Import driver with "import ulnoiot.shield.devkit1_ht"
	5. Temperature and humidity can be read out with the commands "devices["ht1"].temperature()" and "devices["ht1"].humidity()"
	6. Subscribe mqtt with command "mqtt("192.168.12.1", "temp")" and run it with "run()"
	7. The temperature and humidity will the automatically published to "temp/ht1/temperature" and "temp/ht1/temperature"

# Tuesday 13. June 21:00 - 22:00
	* updating team log with movie compilation, debate notes and practical part descriptions
	* updating personal log

# Wednesday 14. June 08:50 - 12:00 and 13:00 - 16:15 [lecture]

## Display sensor
        1. Connect display shield to wemosd1mini
        2. Import driver with "import ulnoiot.shield.devkit1_display"
        3. Displays the current ip and the ulnoiot path
	4. Write text to the display from wemosd1mini with command "devices["dp1"].println("Hallo Flo")"

## Presentations
###Can Bus
	* Automotive field
	* Connecting ECUs

	* Extremely simple, higher throughput than I2C or SMBus
	* No error checking protocols
	* No hot-swapping (dynamically adding notes)
	* Full duplex communication
	* Master/Slave architecture
	* Also one master and multiple slaves possible
	* Signal lines (SCK - Serial clock, MOSI - Master output Slave input, MISO - Master output Slave input, SS - Slave select

### X10

	* Carrier frequency 120 kHz -> transmitted as short bursts
	* 4 bit house code -> 1-4 bit unit code -> 4 bit command
	* One way and two way devices
	* Different modules can be used -> temperature, light, motion, infra-red
	* ioBridge -> translate X10 protocol to a web service
	
### Zigbee

	* Supply voltage of 30V
	
### RS232 / RS422 / RS485 / DMX-512
	* Standards for serial communicatio in 1960s
	* Used in computer serial ports
	* Used in industrial solutions
	* RS-232 -> 256 kbit/s -> 15m max length -> does not define charcter encoding -> full duplex
	* RS-422 -> successor of RS-232 -> up to 10 Mbit/s -> max length not defined	
	* RS-485 -> successor of RS-422 -> multipoint system are supported -> also 10 Mbit/s -> half or full duplex
	* DMX-512 -> Standard for digital communication -> speed is 250 kbit/s -> maximum cable length is 450m -> 3 to 5 wires
