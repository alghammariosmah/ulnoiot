###Gerald Teufl
#Who are you, why are you studying Mobile Computing?
Gerald from lower austria, also did the Bachelor in Mobile Computing, like the smaller systems
which are a mixture of hardware and software, using harware with sensors and develop server software, apps
and the communication between them.

#What do you expect from H&B Automation?
I already have experience with hardware devices and some IoT devices but not in the H&B area. I expect
that I can extend my skills in this area.

#Strength and weaknesses?
My strength are that I have experience with linux, hardware and networks and I like it to work in a team. I
also have no problems with documentation. A weakness and strength at the same time is that I am a 
perfectionist. Moreover, I have basic experience with git but not that much with advanced git functions. 


#Watching two movies and answer questions
What might be doable?
What not?
When?
Weirdness/crazyness?

Movie 1:
Lamp -> doable
Stereo, Music Player -> doable
Public access -> doable
Public access for all things -> not doable in this way they showed
Security/Privacy -> weird, crazy

Technologies:
Wireless access, networks

Movie 2:
Displays -> AR, VR, just one guy monitors everything
Holograms -> not in the near future
Rooms moving -> doable but quiet far away
Doorless doors -> what if somebody is not allowed to enter?
Navigation -> doable
Modularity -> doable
Intelligent networking -> doable
Energy management -> near future
Lightning reacts on emergancy, reaction on full escape ways
Security -> increase security but also opens new doors for security issues

Flash micro sd card
Connect to wifi access point of raspberry pi 3 (iotempire-b78ea5)
Connect via ssh to the raspberry pi 3
Change from password authentication to public/private key authentication
Create key pair and copy public key to authorized keys on raspberry pi 3
mcedit -> editor
change wifi access point name to "teuschro" with "schroteu"

First step:
ulnoiot command to get into the environment
wemosd1mini can then be flashed with the command flash_wemosd1mini
next step is to deploy -> deploy_wemosd1mini (2 times probably)

type "console" -> serial connection
"help" -> help documentation

init led -> "onboardled.init(Pin.OUT)"
toggle led -> "onboardled.on()" and "onboardled.off()"

Connect wemosd1mini with wifi:
wscan -> scan wifi networks
wifi("teuschro", "schroteu")

wip -> shows wireless ip -> 192.168.12.18

pull git repo for new firmware on raspberry pi 3
firmware download -> download newest firmware
fix_bin -> binary fixes
flash_esp8266 -> flashing
-> again deploying

micropython webrepl was not working with Firefox on Linux and Windows but
it works on Microsofts Edge browser on Windows

mqtt("192.168.12.1", "test")
help("shield")

reset
import devkit1_2led3but
devices -> show devices

run() -> to start

byobu -> session management
