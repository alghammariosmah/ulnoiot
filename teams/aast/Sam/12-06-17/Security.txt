##Security
- safety against unexpected human/natural failures 
  * smoke/fire/water sensors
- security against criminals
  * motion detection
  * cameras
  * using light to simulate presence
- monitoring your home
  * children
  * pets
- facilitate the usage of security mechanisms
  * facial recognition
  * automatic door locks
- price advantage over tradtional alarm systems




##Security
- vulnerabilities = operating system
- sending private info
- connection failure. 

- safety against unexpected human/natural failures 
	* detecting fire or even smoke before fire with surveleinces or heat detectors. Thus, we can use automated water pumbers and fire extinguishers
	 in the specific rooms. 
	* in case of flooding, use automated plumping sewers, or redirect the water flow to the sewers. 

- security against criminals
  * When a theif breaks in the house, sensitive motion detectors start firing alarms and sending instant notification to the homeowners. 
  * cameras surveleinces can be used to monitor and detect movements.  
  * Automated lights in case of traveling, which simulates presence.


- monitoring your home
  * children
  * pets
- facilitate the usage of security mechanisms
  * In case relatives come to the house while you are not around, facial recognition can be used to certify home access for them.
  * automatic door locks to limit home access for these people. 

- price advantage over tradtional alarm systems
